## 🎨 Customization

To personalize the portfolio, open `src/App.jsx` and update the following constants at the top of the file:

```js
const DEFAULT_INFO = {
  name: "Your Name",
  tagline: "Your tagline here",
  bio: "Your bio...",
  university: "Your University",
  location: "Your City, Country",
  email: "your@email.com",
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  available: true,
  yearsExp: 2,
  projectsCount: 14,
};
```

To change the **admin password**, update:

```js
const ADMIN_PASS = "your_new_password";
```

To replace the **profile photo**, replace the `PHOTO` constant at the top of `App.jsx` with a new Base64-encoded JPEG string.
